### Type casting
- e.g. dividing an integer with another integer results in an integer
- to get a floating point number, use conversion

```rust
let q:f64 = (a as f64) / (b as f64);
```

### Reading inputs
- read **stdin** from keyboard input
- save to a variable
- for number inputs, type cast first in order to use operators
