To create build and run a project using `cargo` tool

```sh
cargo new my_project
cd my_project
cargo build
cargo run
```

- Cargo tool creates the `myproject.yml` directory and subfiles.  
- `Cargo.toml` contains the project's metadata.  
- `src/main.rs` is where the source code will be written.
- `target/debug/my_project.exe` is the executable file when the compile is successful.
